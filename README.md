Musical Things ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµ

I wanted a place to store anything digital I create during my exploration of 
Music Theory. Because I'm not _really_ creating anything new, this is all usable 
by anyone else who stumbles across what I've created.

## Sheet Music and Licensing
GPL usually means that anything you add to what is provided must be added back 
to the "community." This will not apply to the sheet music blanks. Use them as 
you will.
